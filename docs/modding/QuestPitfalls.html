<h1 id="common-pitfalls">Common pitfalls</h1>

<p>There are a number of pitfalls to using the X-engine for quests. This section documents known issues with the quest engine, and tries to explain them in a general way. Broadly stated, X-engine cannot reliably handle simultaneous events, and imposes a serial or chronological order that the quest author does not realize.</p>
<p>Technically, these are sometimes called <em>race conditions</em>, because, like the winner of a foot race, the task which executes first cannot be predicted by the quest author.</p>
<h3 id="unable-to-check-repute">Unable to check repute</h3>
<p>Using the <code>[when repute with _aFaction_](#factionrepute)</code> condition to examine the PC's standing with a Daggerfall faction can fail spontaneously when the result of that task is examined in a subsequent <code>[when condition](#multipletests)</code>.</p>
<pre><code>\_reputeOK\_ task:
    when repute with Cyndassa is at least 17

\_clickedCyndi\_task:
    clicked \_cyndi\_

\_nextStep\_ task:
    when \_clickedCyndi\_ and not \_reputeOK\_

\_alternateStep\_task:
    when \_clickedCyndi\_ and \_reputeOK\_
</code></pre>
<p>In this quest fragment, it is unpredictable whether _nextStep_ or _alternateStep_ is performed, regardless of the PC's repute with Cyndassa. _nextStep_ may always be performed, and if the PC's repute is high enough, both tasks will execute, which is almost certainly not what you expect to happen.</p>
<p>There is a race between _reputeOK_ and _nextStep_. The order of the tasks in the scenario seems to imply the _reputeOK_ task is considered before the _nextStep_ task, but in fact, X-engine may check the _nextStep_ condition <em>before</em> it checks the _reputeOK_ condition.</p>
<p>The race condition can be partly avoided by rewriting the _reputeOK_ task:</p>
<pre><code>\_reputeOK\_ task:
    when repute with Cyndassa is at least 17
    clear \_nextStep\_

\_clickedCyndi\_task:
    clicked \_cyndi\_

\_nextStep\_ task:
    when \_clickedCyndi\_ and not \_reputeOK\_

\_alternateStep\_task:
    when \_clickedCyndi\_ and \_reputeOK\_
</code></pre>
<p>This rewrite won't work right if either _nextStep_ or _alternateStep_ have <em>any</em> actions associated with them.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's possible to rearrange the steps of a quest to accommodate this race condition. Othertimes it is not. It may be helpful to recall that every task starts out unexecuted, and so some condition which is <em>not</em> is always true to begin with.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="unable-to-repeat-messages">Unable to repeat messages</h3>
<p>How X-engine handles quest dialog is counterintuitive in a number of ways. The basic rule is that <em>any quest condition/response that posts a Qrc message on the screen will be performed no more than once, no matter how many times the conditions for its performance are satisfied.</em></p>
<p>That is, the user will see the message text only the first time such a task is performed, no matter how many subsequent times the task might be reasonably performed.</p>
<p>This seems harmless enough, until you want a quest to post some message in response to clicking on a quest NPC, perhaps to repeat some mission critical quest information. Despite the propaganda in the preceding sections, the X-engine will not provide such service.</p>
<p>Once a condition/response has posted a Qrc message, it will never reshow that message. Period.</p>
<p>This seems to be genuine oversight in the quest engine design. If your quest requires a Qrc message to be repeated in the condition/response section, the only way to make that happen is to arrange for seperate tasks to display the message each time you want the message posted.</p>
<p>This is a fairly severe limit on what a quest can and cannot do.</p>
<p>A common desire is for a quest NPC to repeat a speech as often as the player clicks the mouse on that NPC. X-engine simply does not allow this idiom to be used.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="unable-to-stop-sounds">Unable to stop sounds</h3>
<p>Unlike message posts, a sound once started by the <code>[play sound](#playsound)</code> command performs indefinitely.</p>
<p>To stop a playing sound, clear the task that started it.</p>
<pre><code>Clock \_silence\_

\_makeNoise\_ task:
    play sound halt every 2 minutes 3 times

\_silence\_ task:
    clear \_makeNoise\_
</code></pre>
<p>In this quest fragment, when the _silence_ timer runs down, the noise maker task is stopped.</p>
