# Quest Actions

Quest actions have appeared briefly through the examples of quest conditions, but this section documents all the known activities which can take place during a quest task.

A task may include any number of actions to respond with when its conditions for activation are met. A task may have no explicit actions at all, in which case it serves to remember that one or more conditions have been met.

Quest actions can be divided into groups for

1. Managing inventory
2. Managing geography
3. Managing characters (PC, NPCs, and foes)
4. User interactions
5. Managing special quests
