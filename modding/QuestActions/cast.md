You can magically enhance any foe in a quest by casting one of the standard spells with this action. Of course, you can repeat the action any number of times with different spells to achieve whatever effect you would like to have.

Please see the [spell detection](../QuestConditions.md#noticing-spells-cast) condition for the spell enhancements which are available. For example:

```
cast Free_Action spell on _foe_
cast Spell_Reflection spell on _foe_
cast Shield spell on _foe_
```
