## Creating waves of attacking foes

    create aFoe every m minutes n times with k% success

You can create mobs of enemies to harry the player.

    Message: 1019
      <ce> Ha! You'll never escape with \_item\_.

    Foe \_thief\_ is 3 thief

    from 0:0 to 3:00 daily
        create \_thief\_ every 13 minutes 30 times with 75% success

    when \_thief\_ injured
        say 1019

would dispatch trios of thugs after the PC every night from midnight to 3 am. Some of the thugs won't succeed in locating the PC.

To create foes in a more guarded manner, see `[placing foes in the game world.](#placefoe)`

The spoils from the dead bodies of human foes generated by this command have the interesting properties of (a) improving in quality with each wave and (b) repeating the spoils dropped by the foes dispatched in the previous waves. The spoils are also proportional to player level, so higher level PCs tend to see better goods. But even at level 2 or 3, mithril drops aren't that uncommon.

I've had PCs garner over 5 million gold from such an episode. Even at level 2 or 3, gaining enough gold to purchase a yacht is commonplace.

The enemies spawned by _create foe_ will track the PC, both in town and inside dungeons. Some quests prefer to limit the appearance of spawned mobs to the town areas of the map. See `[_send foe_](#sendfoe)`.

Note that the `[_injured_](#attackingfoes)` condition can be triggered for each wave of attackers, while the `[_killed_](#attackingfoes)` condition will only trigger up to the number of foes determined from the Foe command, no matter how many of them are actually slaughtered by the PC.


## Creating an NPC somewhere in the game world

    create npc anNPC

This action generates anNPC (described by a Person command) at that NPC's birthplace in the current province.

    Person \_contact\_ faction The\_Cabal female anyInfo 1012

    \_foundHint\_ task:
        create npc \_contact\_

installs the \_contact\_ npc at a place in the current province, probably not local to the PC, and hopefully in a venue appropriate to the npc's group or faction.


## Creating an NPC at a specific place

    create npc at aPlace

Although I've called this _create npc_, _reserve sprite_ may be more appropriate. In the existing quests it is invariably followed by a _place npc_ at the same place, and occasionally by _place item_ at the same place or by _create foe_ at the same place.

Its purpose seems to be to inform **X-engine** that a particular site will have an item sprite or an npc sprite teleported to it during the quest.

At least, so far as my testing has shown, _create npc at_ without a corresponding _place npc_ action has no visible effect in the game world.

See the `[place NPC](#placenpc)` command for the usual way of positioning an NPC in the game world.

In general, permanent NPCs use the create npc action prior to using the place npc action. A permanent NPC used only with the place npc action isn't guaranteed to be visible within the game world.
