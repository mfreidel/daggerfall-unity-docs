The PC can be afflicted by disease, either during a quest (see [make pc ill](./make.md#infecting-the-player)) or through exposure to various elements (foes with poisoned blades, were-things, etc).

When a quest proceeds to the point where the PC should be cured, the _cure_ action removes the malady in question from the player character. A quest can cure any disease inflicted by the make pc ill action, as well as cure lycanthropy or vampirism.
