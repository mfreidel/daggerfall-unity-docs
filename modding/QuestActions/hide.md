> Hiding NPCs from the player character

```
hide npc anNPC
```

This action removes the specified quest NPC sprite from the game world. See [restore npc](./restore.md) action to replace the NPC sprite.

Hidden NPCs are invisible to the player character, but any Qrc messages associated with that NPC will work properly; the PC is just unable to see the NPC anywhere in the game world.
