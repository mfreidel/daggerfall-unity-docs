# location

> The operation of this action is unknown. It appears in the quest startup for two quests: _b0c00y13_ (exterminate the vermin) and _a0c10y05_ (shotgun wedding).

```
location aPlace number1 number2
```

number2 is approximately the number of game minutes allotted to the duration of the quest.

number1 seems to be a percentage, and is 100 in both examples.

This appears to serve as an 'attractor' for created foes, to direct them to the location where the PC is supposed to encounter them in the quest, rather than relying on their pathfinding skills.
