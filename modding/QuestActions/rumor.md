# rumor mill

> Adding an explicit rumor

```
rumor mill nnnn
```

This action adds the Qrc message block nnnn to the set of rumors that an NPC may respond with when asked about _Any News_ in the dialog screen.

Be aware, however, that its selection is random. If you put "mission critical" information in such a Qrc block with this command, it may take the PC many chat sessions to extract the response. It would be convenient if a high etiquette skill improved the odds of getting the response out of the NPC.
