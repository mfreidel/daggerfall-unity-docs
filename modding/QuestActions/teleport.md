# teleport

> Teleporting the PC

```
teleport pc to aPlace
transfer pc inside aPlace  province#  magicNumber
```

You can relocate the PC to another position in the current province by using the teleport pc form of the command. Existing quests use this to relocate the PC to a remote dungeon trap in the same province, as though the teleport spell anchor were placed there.

It isn't known whether this form of the command will teleport the PC to permanent sites.

The alternate form, transfer pc, is used at the end of the main story when Nulfaga teleports the PC to the final dungeon of the Mantellan Crux. It is also used to return the PC to Nulfaga when the Crux quest is completed.

province# and magicNumber are determined as for the [reveal](./reveal.md) command.
